# MySQL Basic exercises

## Part 1

- Create a `becode` database.
- Import the `students.sql` file.


## Part 2

In a second .sql file, you'll store the queries that will enable you to perform these actions:

- Display all data.
- Display first names only.
- Display first names, dates of birth and school.
- Show only female students.
- Displays only students who belong to Addy's school.
- Displays only students' first names, in reverse alphabetical order
(DESC). Next, the same thing, but limiting the results to 2.
- Adds Ginette Dalor, born 01/01/1930 and living in Brussels, still in
SQL.
- Modify Ginette (still in SQL) and change her gender and first name to "Omer".
- Delete the person whose ID is 3.
- Change the contents of the School column so that "1" is replaced by "Liege" and "2" is replaced by "Gent". (pay attention to column type!)
- Do a few more operations to see if you've got it right.
