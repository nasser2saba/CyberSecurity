## The mission

Welcome to the exciting world of cybersecurity! In this exciting 48-hour web application penetration testing challenge, you'll step into the shoes of ethical hackers and security experts. Your mission, spread over two days, is to thoroughly assess the security of a web application deployed on the Azure cloud. Your objective is to uncover vulnerabilities that could potentially compromise the application's confidentiality, integrity and availability.

Throughout this intensive challenge, you'll immerse yourself in hands-on experience with a variety of common vulnerabilities, enabling you to understand the importance of robust security practices and the potential risks businesses face in the digital world.

### **Vulnerabilities to Exploit**:

1. **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** XSS is a vulnerability that allows attackers to inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users. This can lead to the theft of sensitive data, session hijacking, or even defacement of the website.
    
2. **SQL Injection:** SQL injection occurs when an attacker manipulates user input to execute unauthorized SQL queries on a database. Exploiting this vulnerability can lead to unauthorized access, data leakage, or even complete loss of control over the database.
    
3. **Insecure Direct Object Reference:** This vulnerability arises when an application exposes internal objects, such as files or database records, without proper authorization checks. Exploiting this flaw can lead to unauthorized access to restricted resources.
    
4. **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) on App Function Environment:** SSRF is an attack that tricks the server into making unintended requests to internal resources or external systems. In this challenge, you'll target the App Function environment to gain unauthorized access to sensitive data or services.
    
5. **Sensitive Data Exposure and Password Reset:** This category involves identifying flaws that expose sensitive data or allow attackers to compromise the password reset mechanism, potentially leading to unauthorized account access.
    
6. **Storage Account Misconfigurations:** Misconfigured storage accounts can allow unauthorized access to sensitive files or data stored in cloud environments. You will exploit this weakness to showcase the risks of improper cloud storage configuration.
    
7. **Identity Misconfigurations:** Incorrectly configured identity and authentication mechanisms can lead to unauthorized access to application features or data. You will uncover and exploit these misconfigurations to demonstrate their potential impact.
    
By navigating through these vulnerabilities, you will not only learn about their technical aspects but also gain insights into the strategies that cybercriminals may employ to compromise applications and systems. Your mission is to find, exploit, and report these vulnerabilities while adhering to ethical guidelines and best practices.

Remember, the skills you acquire during this challenge will be invaluable in your journey to becoming a proficient cybersecurity professional. So, gear up, collaborate with your teammates, and prepare to dive into a real-world simulation of cybersecurity threats and defenses. Your success in this endeavor will contribute to a safer and more secure digital world.

Aside from the hands-on exploitation, participants are required to submit a thorough write-up detailing their findings, methodologies, and recommended solutions. This report showcases your capacity not only to identify vulnerabilities but also to effectively communicate complex technical information.

<br> 

## Write-Up Guidelines:

1. **Executive Summary:** Offer a concise overview of your findings, focusing on critical vulnerabilities and potential impacts.
    
2. **Methodology:** Explain your step-by-step process for identifying and exploiting each vulnerability, including tools used and challenges faced.
    
3. **Vulnerability Descriptions:** Detail each vulnerability, its origins, and the potential consequences of exploitation.
    
4. **Proof of Concept (PoC):** Include code or screenshots demonstrating the successful exploitation of each vulnerability.
    
5. **Impact Assessment:** Evaluate the impact of each vulnerability on the application and organization, considering confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
    
6. **Risk Prioritization:** Rank vulnerabilities by severity, accounting for exploitability, potential damage, and ease of mitigation.
    
7. **Mitigation Recommendations:** Provide actionable solutions for each vulnerability, explaining preventive measures and potential code adjustments.
    
8. **Lessons Learned:** Reflect on the experience, highlighting successes, challenges, and areas for improvement.
    
9. **Conclusion:** Summarize key takeaways and emphasize the importance of prompt vulnerability resolution.

## Submission Guidelines:

1. Your write-up should be clear, organized, and submitted in PDF format.
2. Use headings, subheadings, and bullet points for clarity.
3. Ensure the write-up is well-structured, coherent, and free of grammatical errors.
4. Include visuals, code snippets, or diagrams to enhance explanations.

<br> 

## Evaluation Criteria:

Your write-up will be evaluated based on accuracy, clarity, methodology, impact assessment, mitigation recommendations, and overall communication skills. Effective communication is a crucial asset in cybersecurity.

We eagerly anticipate your comprehensive reports on Monday. This challenge provides an exceptional opportunity to showcase your technical acumen and your capacity to convey crucial information to a range of stakeholders.

Good luck, and happy hacking ðŸ”¥
