# Packet-Tracer Network project 
A project about how to build a simple network for a startup using Cisco Packet Tracer.


This is a project made in March 2024 with saba, Pell√©as and Aziz.

It contains a .pka file demonstrating on how to create a simple network that could belong to a startup by using the simulation tool cisco packet Tracer.

This a a project meant to be cheap but some additional costs were made in order to ensure it's functionality and scalability like the use of GigabitEthernet cables from the layer 3 switch to the other switches and routers. It could be made significantly cheaper by using an inferior router and layer 3 switch, but it would downgrade the efficiency.
Explanation about the inner and outer structure of the project have been described in the .odt file.
Explanation as to how to configure the several devices and and services via CLI have been given in the CLI directory.

Some evolution as well as a more detailed explanation as how to make on such project may follow.

Help yourself with it !
